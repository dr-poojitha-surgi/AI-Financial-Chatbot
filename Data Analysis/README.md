# Financial Performance Analysis: Microsoft, Apple, Tesla (2022 - 2024)

## Project Overview

This project performs a comprehensive financial performance analysis of **Microsoft, Apple, and Tesla** based on manually curated financial datasets extracted from their SEC 10-K filings for the fiscal years **2022, 2023, and 2024**. The analysis highlights key financial metrics, trends, and ratios that provide insights into the companies' financial health and operational performance over time.

The Python code and associated notebooks in this repository conduct data loading, cleaning, metric computation, and visualization to support strategic consulting insights.

## Data Description

The dataset (`company_financials.csv`) contains the following financial metrics at the company-year level:

- Total Revenue (USD millions)
- Net Income (USD millions)
- Total Assets (USD millions)
- Total Liabilities (USD millions)
- Cash Flow from Operating Activities (USD millions)
- Revenue Growth (% year-over-year)
- Net Income Growth (% year-over-year)
- Asset to Liability Ratio
- Cash Flow Year-over-Year Percentage Change

The data is manually extracted from SEC 10-K reports and organized for multi-year comparative analysis.

## Analysis Highlights

- Calculation of year-over-year growth rates in revenue and net income.
- Computation of leverage via asset-to-liability ratios.
- Cash flow trend analysis to assess operational efficiency.
- Comprehensive summary statistics for all companies and years.
- Visual exploration through time-series plots and financial ratio charts.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Visualizations

The repository includes visualizations demonstrating trends and comparisons for each financial metric. Example images include:

- Revenue growth trends across companies and years
- Net income variability and growth
- Asset-liability ratio changes over time
- Cash flow operational changes year-over-year
